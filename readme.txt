Q: Were there areas of unexpected complexity? If so, how did you handle them or how did you decide to cut scope?
A: We had to cut down on authentication due to time constraints. We managed to get images working, thankfully!

Q: What was the most interesting part of the final project?
A: Getting images stored in MongoDB and decoded using buffers was pretty neat.

Q: If you had more time, what do you wish you could have added to the final project?
A: Optional images for each reply would have probably been the next step for this project.
